# benchmark

This app benchmarks the Base58 implementation in this repo, along with the other main
Crystal implementations.

## Installation

Don't install it. It's just here to generate some interesting numbers.

That said, it does contain some nice enhancements to Crystal's Benchmark::IPS which might find their way into a Crystal PR at some point.

## Usage

shard run --release
